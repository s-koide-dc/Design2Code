# AI Changelog

- **2026-05-28**: Relaxed `scripts/validate_project_consistency.py` so warning-only runs now return exit code 0 while still reporting warnings on stderr, matching the intended separation between must-fix doc/consistency errors and review-only freshness drift; added an integration regression for the warning-only path.

- **2026-05-28**: Hardened the CI-facing regression path by (1) making `validate_project_consistency.py` resolve stale absolute workspace links back into the current repo when possible while ignoring non-repo absolute artifacts, (2) narrowing inline path validation to committed source/doc-style extensions instead of generated assets like `txt` / `npy` / `db`, (3) suppressing warning-level logging during `run_unit_smoke.py`, and (4) forcing documented pipeline-entrypoint tests to rebuild intent vectors from an asset-free dummy vector engine instead of relying on local vector caches.

- **2026-05-28**: Fixed the default-smoke regression to assert that `test_vector_cache_required` is excluded from CI-oriented default runs, and documented in `scripts/README.md` that GitHub Actions executes only asset-free smoke profiles because chiVe, caches, and `dictionary.db` are not committed.

- **2026-05-28**: Split `test_vector_cache_required` out of the default `run_unit_smoke.py` targets into a dedicated `assets` profile and changed the GitHub Actions workflow to run only `core`, `parser`, and `synthesis`, so CI no longer depends on local vector-cache assets that are absent on GitHub-hosted runners.

- **2026-05-28**: Updated `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` from `actions/checkout@v4` / `actions/setup-python@v5` to `@v6`, aligning the CI workflow with GitHub's Node 24-compatible action releases and removing the runner deprecation warning path reported after commit.

- **2026-05-28**: Expanded the `run_unit_smoke.py` profile documentation in `scripts/README.md` to list the exact test modules behind `core`, `parser`, and `synthesis`, and added a short source comment explaining why the smoke profile set stays explicit.

- **2026-05-28**: Documented `python scripts/validate/run_unit_smoke.py --profile core --verbosity 2` in `scripts/README.md` as the shortest local smoke path, reflecting the new profile split with a concrete operator-facing command.

- **2026-05-28**: Added `core` / `parser` / `synthesis` profile selection to `scripts/validate/run_unit_smoke.py` while preserving the expanded default suite, documented the profile behavior, and fixed the `parser` profile success path with an integration regression.

- **2026-05-28**: Broadened the default `scripts/validate/run_unit_smoke.py` suite with lightweight configuration/design/dependency guards (`test_config_manager`, `test_design_doc_parser`, `test_dependency_resolver`, `test_json_deserialize_guard`), documented the expanded default set, and added an integration regression that fixes the default-smoke stdout success path.

- **2026-05-28**: Expanded `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` to run `scripts/validate/run_unit_smoke.py --verbosity 2`, so the existing public-entrypoint/security/consistency checks are now complemented by the default unit smoke suite in CI; updated the staged improvement memo accordingly.

- **2026-05-28**: Tightened the README's `現在の温度感` section to reflect the now-stable docs-validation boundary, explicitly listing `scripts/validate_project_consistency.py` as a stable entrypoint and noting the mode-based doc policy plus grouped validator reporting.

- **2026-05-28**: Added a short operational checklist to `config/README.md` for `doc_reference_policy.json` changes, documenting the required validator run, integration regression run, and follow-up README/doc mode synchronization.

- **2026-05-28**: Extended `config/README.md` so `doc_reference_policy.json` now documents the exact `validate_project_consistency.py` stderr section mapping from policy keys to `DOCS (...)` and `GENERAL`.

- **2026-05-28**: Documented the new grouped docs-validator stderr layout in `README.md` and `scripts/README.md`, so operators can see that `validate_project_consistency.py` now separates `GENERAL` errors from the three document-mode sections.

- **2026-05-28**: Grouped `scripts/validate_project_consistency.py` stderr output by `GENERAL`, `DOCS (required)`, `DOCS (existence-only)`, and `DOCS (optional-reference)` sections while preserving the per-line diagnostics, and synchronized the integration assertions for the new scan order.

- **2026-05-28**: Updated `scripts/validate_project_consistency.py` to include doc-validation mode labels in stderr diagnostics, so missing or broken docs now explicitly report whether they failed under `required`, `existence-only`, or `optional-reference` handling; synchronized the corresponding integration assertions.

- **2026-05-28**: Added matching document-contract notes to `docs/generate_from_design_dataflow.md` and `docs/method_store_spec.md`, aligning the whole `required_docs` set around a consistent statement of what each document owns relative to the README.

- **2026-05-28**: Added a short document-contract note to `docs/project_overview.md`, clarifying that it is a `required_docs` overview tied to the README's public entrypoints while serving as the broader internal structure map.

- **2026-05-28**: Annotated the README's main document list with doc-validation modes, so readers can immediately distinguish `required_docs` from `existence_only_docs` without cross-checking the policy file.

- **2026-05-28**: Added direct links from the README entrypoint section to `config/README.md` and `resources/README.md`, so readers can move from each public entrypoint to its configuration dependencies and representative generated assets without searching the repository.

- **2026-05-28**: Extended `config/README.md` with an entrypoint-to-config map, so the documented public and maintenance scripts now show which JSON settings they primarily depend on without requiring readers to inspect `ConfigManager` or each CLI source file.

- **2026-05-28**: Extended `resources/README.md` with a setup-to-artifact map, so the bootstrap commands in `README.md` now trace directly to the representative files they create or refresh under `resources/`.

- **2026-05-28**: Reworked `resources/README.md` into an explicit inventory document by separating stable reference assets from generated examples and aligning the vector filenames with the current `mc90` artifacts, so its `existence_only_docs` role is clearer and less misleading.

- **2026-05-28**: Documented the doc-validation mode policy in `README.md` and `scripts/README.md`, so operators can tell when a document belongs in `required_docs`, `existence_only_docs`, or `optional_reference_docs` without reading only the raw policy JSON.

- **2026-05-28**: Generalized doc validation modes again by introducing `optional_reference_docs` in `config/doc_reference_policy.json`; temporary planning docs can now be absent without failing validation, but if present their local references are still checked. Added regression coverage for broken links inside the staged-improvement plan doc.

- **2026-05-28**: Added doc-validation modes to `config/doc_reference_policy.json` by introducing `existence_only_docs`, and placed `resources/README.md` under that mode so inventory-style docs are checked for presence without validating every listed generated asset; added regression coverage for both missing existence-only docs and ignored inventory entries.

- **2026-05-28**: Expanded `config/doc_reference_policy.json` again so `config/README.md` is now enforced as a required public document, while explicitly leaving generated-asset inventory docs such as `resources/README.md` out of the required set for now; added regression coverage for a missing required config README.

- **2026-05-28**: Expanded `config/doc_reference_policy.json` so `docs/project_overview.md`, `docs/generate_from_design_dataflow.md`, and `docs/method_store_spec.md` are now treated as required public docs alongside the README pair and stdout policy; added regression coverage for a missing required overview document.

- **2026-05-28**: Added regression coverage for malformed `config/doc_reference_policy.json`, so `scripts/validate_project_consistency.py` now has a fixed stderr failure path when `required_docs` or `temporary_docs` stop being string arrays.

- **2026-05-28**: Externalized the public-doc monitoring target list into `config/doc_reference_policy.json`, so `scripts/validate_project_consistency.py` now reads its required-doc set from configuration instead of hardcoding it; added regression coverage for both the default temporary-doc behavior and a config override that promotes the plan memo to a required doc.

- **2026-05-28**: Relaxed the new doc-reference validation so `docs/README実装ギャップ段階改善計画.md` is treated as a temporary working note rather than a required public document; `validate_project_consistency.py` now enforces only durable public docs, and regression coverage confirms the temporary plan doc can be absent without failing validation.

- **2026-05-28**: Extended `scripts/validate_project_consistency.py` to validate local references in `README.md`, `scripts/README.md`, and `docs/stdout_output_policy.md`, so broken public-document links now fail the consistency check with stderr diagnostics; added regression coverage for a broken README reference.

- **2026-05-22**: Hardened `scripts/validate_project_consistency.py` for missing or invalid `ai_project_map.json` by initializing its empty-state sets before validation, and added regression coverage for the stderr error path instead of letting the script crash with `UnboundLocalError`.

- **2026-05-22**: Extended the Phase 3 CLI contract to `scripts/sync_project_map.py` and `scripts/validate_project_consistency.py`, separating progress/success to stdout from warnings and errors on stderr, and added regression coverage for missing map files plus the clean success path.

- **2026-05-22**: Extended the Phase 3 CLI contract to `scripts/data/build_knowledge_base.py`, separating maintenance progress to stdout from missing-dictionary warnings and persistence failures on stderr, and added regression coverage for the warning-while-continuing path.

- **2026-05-22**: Extended the Phase 3 CLI contract to the network bootstrap scripts `scripts/data/fetch_jmdict.py` and `scripts/data/fetch_vectors.py`, adding stdout progress, Japanese stderr diagnostics, environment-based URL overrides for deterministic failure testing, and regression coverage for download failures.

- **2026-05-22**: Extended the Phase 3 CLI output contract to `scripts/data/convert_vectors.py` and `scripts/data/parse_jmdict.py`, routing progress to stdout and missing-input failures to Japanese stderr diagnostics, and added regression coverage for those failure paths.

- **2026-05-22**: Localized the main `scripts/generate/generate_from_design.py` stderr diagnostics into Japanese for public-facing failure paths such as missing design docs, policy violations, synthesis failures, and spec-alignment stops, while keeping the stdout/stderr contract added earlier.

- **2026-05-22**: Continued Phase 3 CLI output unification by routing `scripts/generate/generate_from_design.py` progress/success messages to stdout while moving error and warning paths to stderr, and added regression coverage for missing design documents plus policy documentation for the split.

- **2026-05-22**: Started Phase 3 CLI output unification by adding `src/utils/cli_output.py`, updating `scripts/validate/run_tdd.py` so successful runs emit formal JSON on stdout while argument/input failures emit Japanese diagnostics on stderr, and adding regression coverage plus policy documentation for that contract.

- **2026-05-22**: Updated `README.md` to publish two verified conversational entrypoint examples through `Pipeline(is_test_mode=True)`: one for `GET_CWD` and one for `LIST_DIR`, keeping the README aligned with the tested natural-language paths.

- **2026-05-22**: Continued Phase 2 by expanding the real `LIST_DIR` intent corpus with natural folder-listing phrasings and adding integration coverage in `tests/integration/test_documented_entrypoints.py`, so directory-list requests no longer depend on explicitly saying only `一覧`.

- **2026-05-22**: Continued Phase 2 README/implementation alignment by expanding the real `GET_CWD` intent corpus with natural directory-query variants and adding integration coverage in `tests/integration/test_documented_entrypoints.py` so multiple README-safe phrasings stay executable through the pipeline.

- **2026-05-21**: Started staged README/implementation alignment by rewriting `README.md` to reflect verified behavior instead of aspirational claims, adding `docs/README実装ギャップ段階改善計画.md` to sequence the remaining work, and introducing `tests/integration/test_documented_entrypoints.py` to keep the documented public entrypoints executable.

- **2026-05-21**: Fixed C# integration tests in `tests/unit/test_code_synthesizer_integration.py` by instantiating `CodeBuilderClient` with a mock config pointing to `os.getcwd()`, preventing test workspace isolation from hiding C# compilation assets.

- **2026-05-15**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/report.md` as the formal integrated report that connects the research objective, benchmark method, core findings, runtime/schema/policy boundary, implementation sites, operationalization, remaining open issues, and final conclusion into a single document, and synchronized the research indexes accordingly.

- **2026-05-15**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/runtime_schema_policy_boundary.md` to compress the final `runtime / schema / policy` responsibility split into a single statement, and synchronized the research README, document map, outcome memo, and goal-state summary so the closure phase now has an explicit boundary document.

- **2026-05-13**: Added deterministic source provenance for `spec_role=CALCULATE` by introducing `src/ir_generator/calculate_resolution.py`, preserving explicit `source_var` or structural `input_link` as `calculate_source_resolution` / `calculate_source_node_id`, teaching `calc_ops` to prefer exact upstream vars over `active_scope_item` and latest-var fallback, and synchronizing the affected design/research/regression artifacts.

- **2026-05-13**: Extended `ITERATE` continuity from item entity to explicit item alias by preserving `iteration_item_var` / `iteration_item_var_resolution`, propagating that alias through loop codegen so nested branch children keep the same `foreach` item name instead of falling back to generic `item`, and synchronizing the affected design/research/regression artifacts.

- **2026-05-13**: Materialized deterministic default retry-policy provenance for `spec_role=WRAP` by extending `wrapper_resolution` to emit `default_attempts` / `default_exception_type` / `default_no_delay_policy`, preserving those resolution fields through `IREmitter` into `retry` statements, adding direct IR/code-synthesis regressions for default-policy wrappers, and synchronizing the wrapper design/research/regression artifacts.

- **2026-05-11**: Added deterministic literal-return handling by introducing `src/ir_generator/return_resolution.py`, preserving `return_value` / `return_value_resolution` for `true` / `false` / `null` / numeric / quoted-literal returns, teaching `ActionSynthesizer` to prioritize that metadata over latest-variable fallback, adding direct IR/code-synthesis regressions for literal returns, and synchronizing the affected design/research artifacts.

- **2026-05-12**: Extended `RETURN` stabilization from literal-only metadata to exact upstream source preservation by normalizing explicit `source_var`, attaching `return_source_node_id` for non-literal chained returns, prioritizing input-link-derived exact var resolution over latest-typed-var fallback in `ActionSynthesizer`, and updating the role-weakening baseline to cover chained return integrity.

- **2026-05-12**: Added `case_32_return_provenance_contrast` plus `return_provenance_observation.md` to close the research loop for `RETURN` provenance, fixing branch-local return-source metadata so `input_link_var` points at the semantic upstream source rather than the structural `CONDITION` base.

- **2026-05-12**: Added `return_provenance_supply_model.md` plus `case_33` / `case_34` and `return_provenance_supply_observation.md` to fix the supply boundary for `RETURN` provenance, distinguishing deterministic `input_link_var` supply from provenance-free weak retention when no literal or structural source is available.

- **2026-05-11**: Elevated `spec_role=WRAP` from marker-comment preservation to deterministic retry semantics by emitting structured `retry` statements in `IREmitter`, teaching both the Python fallback renderer and C# `CodeBuilder` to render them as `for + try/catch + break/rethrow`, adding direct integration assertions for wrapper code generation, and documenting the new wrapper-semantics boundary in code-synthesis and research artifacts.

- **2026-05-11**: Added deterministic wrapper-metadata resolution for retry semantics by introducing `src/ir_generator/wrapper_resolution.py`, preserving explicit `max_attempts` / `exception_type`, inferring retry count only from tokenized `<number> + 回` sequences, and extending IR/code-synthesis regressions to verify explicit retry metadata reaches generated C#.

- **2026-05-11**: Extended retry-wrapper semantics with explicit delay/backoff policy propagation by preserving `base_delay_ms`, `max_delay_ms`, and `backoff_multiplier` metadata from IR through `IREmitter` into both the Python fallback renderer and C# `CodeBuilder`, with sync `Thread.Sleep` / async `Task.Delay` generation and matching regression coverage.

- **2026-05-11**: Fixed `CodeBuilderClient` executable selection to choose the newest available Debug/Release binary instead of always preferring Release, preventing stale CodeBuilder builds from masking current retry-semantics changes in runtime validation.

- **2026-05-11**: Strengthened runtime-side handling for weak structural/transform roles by (1) bridging `spec_role=TRANSFORM` with weak `GENERAL/ACTION` intent to the transform handler in `ActionSynthesizer`, and (2) adding a conservative `spec_role=WRAP` consumer in `IREmitter` that preserves wrapper child bodies with a `wrapper:retry` marker instead of collapsing to a generic fallback action; added direct integration regressions for `TRANSFORM`, `ITERATE`, and `WRAP`, and synchronized the affected design/research documents.

- **2026-05-08**: Added `--update-run-file` support to `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` so the runner can reconstruct and rewrite a regression run record in place from the current draft generators, and documented the in-place update flow in the combined playbook, templates README, results README, and scripts catalog.

- **2026-05-08**: Added `--write-draft` and optional `--draft-file` support to `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py`, verified default draft emission into `research/ir_meaning_preservation/results/regression_run_2026_05_07_metadata_baseline.runner_draft.md`, and documented the default/output override behavior in the playbook, templates README, scripts catalog, and results README.

- **2026-05-08**: Extended `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` one final step to emit a paste-ready `Final Judgment` draft sourced from the current run file, and updated the playbook/template documentation to state that the runner can now regenerate the full operational body of a regression record as draft text.

- **2026-05-08**: Completed the regression-record drafting support in `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` by adding a paste-ready `Final Judgment` candidate block sourced from the current run file's regression status, open risks, and next action, so the runner now proposes draft content for the full operational body of a regression record.

- **2026-05-07**: Completed the regression-run draft generator by extending `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` to emit paste-ready `Output Path Check` and `Deliverables Produced` blocks, so the runner now covers the full operational body of a regression record aside from final judgment editing.

- **2026-05-07**: Extended `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` to emit paste-ready draft blocks for `Affected Claims` and `Downstream Conservatism Check`, reusing the current run file's claim text, claim-map references, consumer list, and stronger/weaker fallback notes so a follow-up regression record can be drafted with minimal manual copying.

- **2026-05-07**: Extended `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` so the runner now emits a paste-ready `Change Summary` / `Benchmark Coverage` draft block by reusing the current run file's changed-area, related-file, and benchmark-coverage entries, reducing manual rewriting when preparing the next regression record.

- **2026-05-07**: Extended `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` again so the runner now emits a paste-ready draft block for `Role Weakening Check` and `Alias Admission Check`, seeded from the run file's affected roles and alias timing root plus the corresponding regression-table checks.

- **2026-05-07**: Added a shared `scripts/validate/ir_meaning_preservation_regression_lib.py` helper and extended `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` so the runner now reprints the exact `Regression Check` rows implied by the run file's `Affected spec_role` values and alias timing root/admission state, both in the console summary and in the paste-ready markdown block.

- **2026-05-07**: Improved `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` so the runner now captures each step's output and emits a paste-ready markdown block for the `Validation Run` section of a regression record, with concise logical commands (`python ...`) and summarized outcomes instead of raw interpreter paths.

- **2026-05-07**: Extended `validate_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` to verify that `Affected spec_role` values exist in `results/role_weakening_regression_table.md` and that the run-record alias timing root / admission state resolves to a valid row in `results/schema_alias_admission_regression_table.md`, with explicit normalization from operational states (`Admit Now`, `Hold For Evidence`, `Reject`) to table states (`admitted`, `not admitted`); updated the playbook and regression template accordingly.

- **2026-05-07**: Added `scripts/validate/run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` to execute the standard IR meaning-preservation playbook as a single command by chaining project-map sync, project consistency validation, regression-run validation, and an optional predefined IR test suite; wired it into the safety whitelist, scripts catalog, regression template, playbook, checklist, and results/template indexes, and verified it against the metadata-baseline run with the `ir-core` suite.

- **2026-05-07**: Added `scripts/validate/validate_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` to semi-automate IR meaning-preservation regression runs by validating the run-record structure, required policy/result assets, output-path review section, and referenced files; updated the regression template, baseline run record, playbook, checklist, scripts catalog, safety whitelist, and results/template READMEs to use the new validator.

- **2026-05-07**: Integrated `docs/stdout_output_policy.md` into the research-operation layer by extending the regression run template, benchmark addition template, regression checklist, combined playbook, and templates README with explicit output-path verification steps.

- **2026-05-07**: Backfilled missing output-path guidance in source-level design documents for `ActionSynthesizer`, `IRGenerator`, `DesignDocRefiner`, `Replanner`, and `ServiceGeneration`, aligning them with `docs/stdout_output_policy.md` so the `stdout / stderr / debug_print / logger` boundary is documented consistently.

- **2026-05-07**: Added `docs/stdout_output_policy.md` to normalize the project's output channels into `Formal CLI stdout`, `Formal CLI stderr`, `debug_print`, and `logger`, and linked it from `docs/project_overview.md` as the canonical guide for future output-path changes.

- **2026-05-07**: Continued internal diagnostic cleanup by moving `ResponseGenerator`, `TDDOperations`, `DesignSyncUtil`, and `SandboxProvisioner` away from unconditional `print` usage toward logger-based reporting, and synchronized their source-level design documents with the no-stdout internal-output policy.

- **2026-05-07**: Continued internal diagnostic cleanup by routing `ProjectGenerator` missing-module notices and `ExecutionVerifier` mock-file notices through `debug_print`, and moving `TemplateRegistry` / `UnifiedKnowledgeBase` load failures to logger-based reporting; synchronized the related source-level design documents and fixed the affected generator helper indentation.

- **2026-05-07**: Continued internal-output cleanup by routing `AutonomousAligner` manual summary output and `StructuralMemory.find_duplicates` candidate tracing through `src.utils.stdout_guard.debug_print`, and synchronized their source-level design documents with the opt-in debug-output policy.

- **2026-05-07**: Defined the stdout/stderr contract for `Pipeline` REPL and `QualityGateChecker` CLI by isolating user-facing stdout emission from diagnostic stderr emission in code, and updated the corresponding source-level design documents to make the output boundary explicit.

- **2026-05-07**: Continued stdout cleanup on internal diagnostic paths by moving `IntentDetector`, `VectorEngine`, `KnowledgeExtractor`, `LogManager`, and `TaskManager` away from unconditional `print` usage toward logger output or `debug_print` fallbacks, and synchronized the corresponding source-level design documents with the revised output policy.

- **2026-05-07**: Extended stdout cleanup across manual verification and internal progress paths by routing `AdvancedTDDSupport`, `ClarificationManager`, `SyntacticAnalyzer`, and `AutonomousSynthesizer` sample/progress output through `src.utils.stdout_guard.debug_print`, and synchronized their source-level design documents with the opt-in debug-output policy.

- **2026-05-07**: Continued stdout cleanup by routing `__main__` demo/sample output in `MorphAnalyzer`, `DesignDocParser`, and `NuGetClient` through `src.utils.stdout_guard.debug_print`, keeping manual inspection paths available behind `NLP_DEBUG_STDOUT` while leaving CLI-facing output untouched; also re-inventoried remaining `print` sites to separate user-facing paths from future cleanup targets.

- **2026-05-07**: Continued stdout cleanup across the design-to-code pipeline by moving internal diagnostic output in `CodeBuilderClient`, `Replanner`, `DesignDocRefiner`, `ServiceGenerationHelper`, and `ProjectGenerator` away from unconditional `print` usage toward logger/debug-gated paths, and synchronized the affected source-level design documents with the new output policy.

- **2026-05-07**: Moved the `DI Generated Code` dump in `tests/unit/test_code_synthesizer_integration.py` behind the opt-in `NLP_TEST_DEBUG_STDOUT` flag so normal test runs stay quiet while keeping a targeted diagnostic path available.

- **2026-05-07**: Cleaned up always-on debug output in `IRGenerator` and `ActionSynthesizer` by routing diagnostic prints through `src/utils/stdout_guard.py` as opt-in `NLP_DEBUG_STDOUT` logging, and updated the corresponding source-level design documents to reflect the new stdout policy.

- **2026-05-07**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/combined_regression_playbook.md` to combine role-weakening and schema-alias-admission regression into one repeatable operating procedure, and linked it from the research summary indexes.

- **2026-05-07**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/results/schema_alias_admission_regression_table.md` to normalize alias-admission regression checks by timing root, admission state, IR effect, downstream impact, and required verification points, and linked it from the research indexes.

- **2026-05-07**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/results/role_weakening_regression_table.md` to normalize role-weakening regression checks by `spec_role`, runtime bridge point, baseline status, evidence, and required verification points, and linked it from the research indexes.

- **2026-05-07**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/results/regression_run_2026_05_07_metadata_baseline.md` as the first concrete regression-run record based on the new templates, fixing the current metadata-driven IR/synthesis behavior as an operational baseline after running the focused IR/code-synthesis test suite and project consistency validation.

- **2026-05-07**: Added reusable research operation templates under `research/templates/` for IR meaning-preservation regression runs and benchmark additions, and linked them from the research README, document map, and schema-alias/role-weakening checklist so the current claims can be carried into repeatable validation workflows.

- **2026-05-07**: Added missing source-level design documents for `design_parser.data_source_utils`, `design_parser.design_inference`, `ir_generator.check_resolution`, `ir_generator.promotion_rules`, `ir_generator.spec_role_rules`, `ir_generator.target_resolution`, `utils.entity_inference`, and `utils.stdout_guard`, and refreshed the module-level design documents for `ir_generator`, `action_synthesizer`, `semantic_binder`, and `calc_ops` to match the current metadata-driven IR and synthesis flow.

- **2026-05-01**: Updated the module design documents to match the current IR meaning-preservation implementation: rewrote `docs/ir_design.md`, expanded `docs/generate_from_design_dataflow.md` with role-specific resolution and metadata-driven synthesis flow, added `docs/ir_generator_module_design.md`, and refreshed `docs/project_overview.md` with the decomposed `ir_generator` and code-synthesis metadata consumer map.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/executive_summary.md` as a short external-facing summary that compresses the current research into its problem statement, main findings, demonstrated outcomes, and final framing.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/goal_state.md` to define the research endpoint, done conditions, and the boundary between expansion work and closure work.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/schema_alias_role_weakening_regression_checklist.md` to convert the current role-weakening and alias-admission claims into a concrete regression workflow for future schema and IR changes.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/implementation_priority_from_claims.md` to derive the next implementation priorities from the `substantiated` vs `implemented` split in the claim/evidence/implementation map.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/claim_evidence_implementation_map.md` to connect each research claim to its benchmark evidence and implementation sites, making the research-to-code trace explicit.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/research_outcome_memo.md` to compress the current research into a one-page memo organized by the three layers `role`, `provenance`, and `alias admission timing`.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/results/schema_alias_admission_status_table.md` to normalize current alias-admission status across the five timing roots, making schema admission state and IR-side canonicalization readable without opening each case file.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/schema_alias_admission_timing_matrix.md` to normalize the five alias-admission timing roots into a single cross-case table, and integrated that layer into the midterm synthesis beside role and provenance.

- **2026-05-01**: Captured observed IR for `case_31_external_compatibility_threshold`, extending `research/ir_meaning_preservation/results/schema_alias_admission_threshold_observation.md` so schema-admission timing is now grounded in five roots: `Hold For Evidence`, `Repeated Spec Use`, `Cross-Case Relevance`, `Downstream Impact`, and `External Compatibility`.

- **2026-05-01**: Captured observed IR for `case_29_cross_case_relevance_threshold` and `case_30_downstream_impact_threshold`, extending `research/ir_meaning_preservation/results/schema_alias_admission_threshold_observation.md` so admission timing is now grounded in `Hold For Evidence`, `Repeated Spec Use`, `Cross-Case Relevance`, and `Downstream Impact`.

- **2026-05-01**: Captured observed IR for `case_27_admissible_but_deferred_alias` and `case_28_repeated_spec_use_promotes_alias`, and added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/results/schema_alias_admission_threshold_observation.md` to show that admission threshold is best modeled as schema-admission timing rather than runtime inference.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/schema_alias_admission_threshold.md` to define when owner-confined but low-evidence aliases should be admitted now, held for evidence, or rejected, separating `can_admit` from `should_admit_now`.

- **2026-05-01**: Captured observed IR for `case_24_conditional_alias_with_owner_explanation` and `case_25_generic_abbreviation_rejection`, and added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/results/schema_alias_tier2_observation.md` to show that `Tier 2` alias admission depends on owner explanation and canonical non-ambiguity rather than abbreviation surface alone.

- **2026-05-01**: Captured observed IR for `case_22_allowed_alias_admission` and `case_23_disallowed_generic_alias_rejection`, and added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/results/schema_alias_coverage_observation.md` to show that policy-approved alias admission and intentionally rejected generic alias retention are now cleanly distinguishable.

- **2026-05-01**: Added alias-coverage policy contrast benchmarks `case_22_allowed_alias_admission.md` and `case_23_disallowed_generic_alias_rejection.md` to distinguish policy-approved alias admission from intentionally rejected generic alias retention.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/schema_alias_supply_model.md` to define how property aliases must be supplied deterministically through `entity_schema`, including exact-match-only canonicalization, canonical ambiguity rejection, and the boundary between alias supply and provenance promotion.

- **2026-05-01**: Extended property-side provenance promotion with deterministic schema aliases, allowing Japanese lexical property tokens such as `在庫` / `合計金額` to canonicalize to `Stock` / `Total` when explicitly declared in schema metadata, and re-captured the boundary cases as successful `schema_property` / `history_*` separations.

- **2026-05-01**: Implemented the first property-side provenance promotion in `IRGenerator`: canonical schema property names can now lift `CHECK.subject_resolution` to `schema_property` / `history_subject` and `FILTER.predicate_resolution` to `schema_property` / `history_predicate` when owner uniqueness or exact-scope uniqueness is deterministically available.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/property_side_provenance_promotion_rule.md` to define the minimal promotion rules for lifting `CHECK.subject_resolution` and `FILTER.predicate_resolution` from lexical/logic-goal retention into `schema_backed` or `history_based` property provenance.

- **2026-05-01**: Extended cross-role provenance-based downstream conservatism with a first `history_based` middle policy: `CHECK.history_subject` now allows only exact-target property resolution, and `FILTER.history_predicate` / `history_collection` now avoid strong shortcut generation while still permitting generic logic-based `.Where(...)`.

- **2026-05-01**: Applied the first cross-role provenance-based downstream conservatism for `CHECK` and `FILTER`: weak `CHECK.subject_resolution` now blocks schema-backed property lifting in comparison generation, and weak `FILTER` predicate/collection provenance now stops property-aware LINQ generation with an explicit TODO instead of over-concretizing.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `research/ir_meaning_preservation/cross_role_provenance_design.md` to unify `CHECK`, `FILTER`, and `CALCULATE` under a common `resolved value + provenance + downstream policy` design, including a shared provenance-strength lattice and role-specific field mappings.

- **2026-05-01**: Completed another orchestration-focused in-file decomposition step in `IRGenerator` by extracting `ELSE` / `END` handling, redundant `DATABASE_QUERY` suppression, and context-history appends into dedicated helpers, leaving the main generation path closer to a pure orchestration skeleton while preserving existing behavior and tests.

- **2026-05-01**: Consolidated phase-3 role-specific semantic resolution inside `IRGenerator` into a dedicated helper that applies structure-role annotation, CHECK metadata enrichment, and CALCULATE target/entity-resolution bridging before final runtime coercion, while preserving existing behavior and tests.

- **2026-05-01**: Advanced the in-file decomposition of `IRGenerator` again by extracting auto-inserted JSON deserialize/serialize node handling into local helpers for collection-input detection, current-structure append, upstream string-output checks, and JSON bridge node insertion, while preserving existing behavior and tests.

- **2026-05-01**: Advanced the in-file decomposition of `IRGenerator` by extracting final intent/runtime-role coercion and pre-emission node shaping into local helpers for runtime intent normalization, source-kind resolution, cardinality finalization, and node construction, while preserving existing behavior and tests.

- **2026-05-01**: Advanced the structural-dependency in-file decomposition inside `IRGenerator` by extracting chaining and block-attachment rules into local helpers for collection-link lookup, structural `input_link` selection, `ELSE` branch activation, and structural node attachment, while keeping the main generation flow central and preserving tests.

- **2026-05-01**: Extracted the spec-role domain from `IRGenerator` into `src/ir_generator/spec_role_rules.py`, moving specification-facing role inference behind a thin delegating wrapper while preserving existing behavior and tests.

- **2026-05-01**: Extracted the first module-level helper from `IRGenerator` by moving CHECK resolution logic into `src/ir_generator/check_resolution.py` and leaving thin delegating wrappers in `IRGenerator`, preserving behavior while reducing in-class bulk.

- **2026-05-01**: Extended the first in-file decomposition of `IRGenerator` by annotating the main `generate()` flow into explicit phases and marking the promotion helpers as a dedicated domain, making structure analysis, role-specific resolution, final intent coercion, and node emission easier to read.

- **2026-05-01**: Started the first in-file decomposition of `IRGenerator` by adding explicit domain headers and orchestration comments for target resolution, spec-role inference, CHECK resolution, promotion rules, and lexical baseline handling without changing behavior.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `ir_generator_decomposition_plan.md` to define a research-aligned, staged decomposition strategy for the growing `IRGenerator`, separating structural dependency, target resolution, CHECK resolution, promotion rules, and spec-role handling before any physical module split.

- **2026-05-01**: Implemented the first FILTER promotion rule in `IRGenerator`, allowing ambiguous `抽出` steps with predicate logic goals and upstream collection context to recover `LINQ/FILTER`, and observed `property`, `predicate_resolution`, and `collection_resolution` in case 16.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `filter_promotion_rule.md` to define a non-keyword-based FILTER promotion rule using ambiguous lexical evidence plus predicate logic goals and upstream collection context.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `filter_fetch_collapse_analysis.md`, tracing the FILTER failure in the provenance benchmark to an ambiguous `抽出` lexeme being classified as `FETCH` before logic-goal evidence can promote it back to `LINQ/FILTER`.

- **2026-05-01**: Captured the first provenance-focused observations: CHECK already preserves `check_kind` and `check_subject` but lacks explicit `subject_resolution`, while FILTER still collapses to `FETCH` before predicate provenance can be attached.

- **2026-05-01**: Filled concrete expected IR for the new provenance-focused cases, fixing `predicate_resolution=logic_goal` / `collection_resolution=explicit_input_link` as the FILTER baseline and `subject_resolution=quoted_literal` / `history_subject` as the CHECK baseline.

- **2026-05-01**: Added `resolution_provenance_model.md` to generalize CALCULATE-style provenance metadata into a role-specific model for `CHECK` and `FILTER`, and added supplemental benchmark templates for filter predicate provenance and check subject provenance.

- **2026-04-30**: Split no-history entity inference from `CALCULATE` history-based entity resolution so upstream observation can preserve `entity_resolution=history_fallback`, and added `document_map.md` plus a categorized README index to keep IR research documents organized without a risky bulk move.

- **2026-04-30**: Added a `history_fallback` gap benchmark for `CALCULATE`, documenting that upstream observation still collapses some history-derived resolution into `explicit_entity` before the dedicated resolution stage runs.

- **2026-04-30**: Added `calculate_metadata_conservatism_summary.md` as a midpoint research summary showing that IR metadata now controls downstream `CALCULATE` concretization conservatively rather than serving only as observational annotations.

- **2026-04-30**: Added a unified downstream policy for `CALCULATE` `entity_resolution` values, documenting and testing that `history_fallback` allows exact-target synthesis while `ambiguous` disables cross-entity fallback and stays conservative.

- **2026-04-30**: Made downstream `CALCULATE` synthesis conservative for `entity_resolution=ambiguous`, preventing arbitrary POCO/property selection and emitting an explicit TODO stop instead of silently generating over-specific assignments.

- **2026-04-30**: Added observational `semantic_roles.entity_resolution` metadata for `CALCULATE` target-entity bridging so unique-owner and ambiguous-property cases can be distinguished without changing the resolved `target_entity` contract.

- **2026-04-30**: Added schema-backed `CALCULATE` target-entity resolution so property ownership can lift weak `Item` targets to a unique entity without broad keyword heuristics, and added regression coverage to prevent DISPLAY-to-CALC mispromotion.

- **2026-04-30**: Improved `CHECK` subject/property resolution so `null_check` preserves identifier subjects and `comparison_check` can emit loop-scoped property conditions even when `target_entity` remains `Item`.

- **2026-04-30**: Captured observed IR and generated condition expressions for the supplemental `CHECK` cases, and documented the remaining subject/entity resolution gaps.

- **2026-04-30**: Updated condition synthesis to consume `semantic_map.check_kind`, generating `File.Exists`, null guards, and comparison expressions from IR metadata instead of falling back to generic EXISTS handling.

- Phase 3 の stdout/stderr 契約を `scripts/validate/run_unit_smoke.py`, `scripts/validate/run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py`, `scripts/validate/validate_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` へ拡張した。
- `run_unit_smoke.py` は `--test-target` を受け取り、成功時の unittest 出力を stdout、失敗時を stderr に分離するよう更新した。
- `run_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` は run file 未検出と step failure を stderr に寄せ、成功時の runner 出力は stdout に残すよう更新した。
- `validate_ir_meaning_preservation_regression.py` は成功レポートを stdout、run file 未検出や構造エラーを stderr に固定した。
- `tests/integration/test_documented_entrypoints.py` に上記 validate 系 3 本の回帰を追加した。
- Phase 3 の stdout/stderr 契約を `scripts/sync/sync_project_dependencies.py`, `scripts/validate/validate_method_store.py`, `scripts/tools/prune_backups.py` へ拡張した。
- `sync_project_dependencies.py` は `--root` を受け取り、同期完了を stdout、csproj 解析失敗を stderr に分離するよう更新した。
- `validate_method_store.py` は共通 CLI helper と `--strict` の argparse 化を導入し、失敗・警告を stderr、成功のみを stdout に固定した。
- `prune_backups.py` は `--root` を受け取り、dry-run/完了を stdout、backup ディレクトリ未検出や削除失敗を stderr に分離した。
- `tests/integration/test_documented_entrypoints.py` に上記 3 本の回帰を追加し、CLI 出力契約の維持を固定した。

## 2026-05-13
- `CALCULATE` の target-side provenance 4値を benchmark 上で閉じるため、`case_36_calculate_default_target_retention` と対応 observed IR を追加した。
